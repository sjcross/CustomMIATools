# CustomMIATools
Plugin modules for MIA, which aren't included in the main MIA build.

A custom tool could be used in situations where an old version of MIA must be used for compatibility (or consistency with previous analyses), but that old version is missing functionality present in newer builds.  In this case, that custom tool would provide the new functionality in a form compatible with the target version.

Separate plugins are named in the form "[NAME]_[VERSION]", where version values are separated by hyphens rather than dots.

Plugin .jar files can be found in the respective target folders for each tool.
