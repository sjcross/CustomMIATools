# CustomMIATools
Plugin modules for MIA, which aren't included in the main MIA build.

A custom tool could be used in situations where an old version of MIA must be used for compatibility (or consistency with previous analyses), but that old version is missing functionality present in newer builds.  In this case, that custom tool would provide the new functionality in a form compatible with the target version.
